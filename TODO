1. when button is pressed/focused its not possible to change the text color, which is very useful in many cases
2. Icon drawabe is not centered by default?
Actually I solved by adding one line to your code:

    private ImageView setupIconView() {
        if (mIconResource != null) {
            ImageView iconView = new ImageView(mContext);
            iconView.setImageDrawable(mIconResource);
            iconView.setPadding(mIconPaddingLeft, mIconPaddingTop,
                                mIconPaddingRight, mIconPaddingBottom);

            LayoutParams iconViewParams = new LayoutParams(
                LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT, LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);
            if (mTextView != null) {
                if (mIconPosition == POSITION_TOP
                    || mIconPosition == POSITION_BOTTOM) {
                    iconViewParams.gravity = Gravity.CENTER;
                } else {
                    // Added line here
                    iconViewParams.gravity = Gravity.CENTER_VERTICAL;
                }

                iconViewParams.rightMargin = 10;
                iconViewParams.leftMargin = 10;
            } else {
                iconViewParams.gravity = Gravity.CENTER_VERTICAL;
            }
            iconView.setLayoutParams(iconViewParams);

            return iconView;
        }
        return null;
    }

    +1 to this issue. Can iconViewParams.gravity = Gravity.CENTER_VERTICAL be added to the library? I think it is a quite common requirement when configuring icon for the FancyButton. @medyo What do you think?

3. setGravity和drawableTop&Left&Right&Bottom

What he means：
The first question, I found the setGravity or setTextGravity this method does not work, because through the source, found that in your codeSetupTextView () method of textView. SetLayoutParams (new LayoutParams (LayoutParams. WRAP_CONTENT, LayoutParams. WRAP_CONTENT));There are some problems with calls.The layout of the high property is set properly, wide, new LayoutParams (width, height) in which the width to change the value of MATCH_PARENT can solve the problem.The second question, see, through the source code is to use the internal implementation TextView, so, whether the control can be drawableLeft, drawableTop, drawableRight, drawableBottom four attributes to join in?

@medyo I must to say that I agree with @Haegon about gravity, because when I involved FancyButton in my big project I had issues with vertical gravity of text inside button with strictly defined height. So I set TextView's height to MATCH_PARENT and delete some paddings (to fix text cutting) in the code and it solved my problems. Now in my project I have FancyButton with a lot of changes, but I will try later to use version from repo to determine exactly what should be better to change/fix.

4. Add option to set text size as textview android:textAppearance="@android:style/TextAppearance.Medium"
   so can define text size as small medium and large

5. When I am creating a button like this:

   <mehdi.sakout.fancybuttons.FancyButton
   	android:id="@+id/btComments"
   	android:layout_width="64dp"
   	android:layout_height="28dp"
   	android:minHeight="0dp"
   	android:layout_below="@id/vDevider"
   	android:layout_alignParentEnd="true"
   	android:layout_alignParentRight="true"
   	android:layout_marginTop="-2dp"
   	android:padding="0dp"
   	android:minLines="1"
   	android:lines="1"
   	android:maxLines="1"
   	android:text="@string/bt_comments"
   	fancy:fb_borderWidth="1dp"
   	fancy:fb_borderColor="#FF4D3121"
   	fancy:fb_radius="@dimen/fb_radius"
   	fancy:fb_defaultColor="@color/transp"
   	fancy:fb_focusColor="#FFFE9C01"
   	fancy:fb_disabledColor="@color/transp"
   	fancy:fb_textColor="#FF4D3121"
   	fancy:fb_disabledTextColor="@color/colorFbAccentText"
   	fancy:fb_textSize="14sp"
   	fancy:fb_textFont="@string/fb_text_font" />
   Everything is OK on pre-lollipop devices. But on lollipop and higher I see that text of button is clipped at the button, looks like some kind of inner padding or something like that.

   It could be fixed in code:
   btComments.setPadding(0, 0, 0, 0);

   I believe that this is a bug.

7. Please add letter spacing function, it will be great. Thank you !
8. Hello. How can I remove Icon programmatically?
Hi @ZlotIv,
This option isn't available in the current version, however you can remove it like any other view by calling myButton. removeView(myButton.getIconImageObject())
9. Set icon with glide. I tried to set button icon with glide but nothing appear.
Hi @visro,

Try the following

Glide.with(context)
.load(mImage)
.asBitmap()
.into(new SimpleTarget<Bitmap>() {
@Override
public void onResourceReady(Bitmap resource, GlideAnimation<? super Bitmap> glideAnimation) {
     mybutton.getIconImageObject().setImageBitmap(resource);
 }

@Override
public void onLoadFailed(Exception e, Drawable errorDrawable) { }
});
